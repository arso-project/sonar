# Intro

Sonar is an open source framework to manage, annotate, and full-text search through data including media files. It uses peer-to-peer technology to replicate and share collections. Sonar can be used to easily develop decentralized applications.

## What can Sonar be used for?

We imagine a wide range of use cases for Sonar, it is a framework that provides the tools you can use to build upon. Some use cases we explored include: Searchable and replicable media archives, research databases, blogs, archiving and searching of chat logs.

## How to run Sonar

Sonar can run on any computer running Linux, Windows, or macOS. It can run on servers, personal computers and tiny machines like a Raspberry Pi.

We intend to provide packages and installers soon. Currently, you need git and NodeJS to try out Sonar.

*Note: Sonar is still alpha software and currently not yet easily usable for end users*

**See the [README of sonar](https://github.com/arso-project/sonar) for how to setup a development version of Sonar.**
